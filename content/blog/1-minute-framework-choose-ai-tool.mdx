## Why choosing is hard (and how to fix it)
In the last year, the number of AI tools exploded. Lists got longer. Decisions didn’t get easier.
The paradox: more choice, more indecision. You don’t need another mega-directory—you need a fast way to choose.

### The 1-Minute Framework (G-B-X-I)
**Goal → Budget → eXperience → Integrations.** Set these in order, then judge tools against them.

**Goal (G):** Describe the outcome in plain language.  
**Budget (B):** Free, &lt;$20, $20–$100, $100+.  
**eXperience (X):** Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced.  
**Integrations (I):** Notion, Zapier, Slack, Google Drive (if required).

### Three quick examples
**Marketing video repurposing** — G: 1 webinar → 5 shorts; B: &lt;$20; X: Beginner; I: Drive.  
**Developer code assistant** — G: faster TS refactors; B: $20–$100; X: Advanced; I: VS Code, GitHub.  
**Freelancer proposals** — G: draft from notes; B: Free; X: Intermediate; I: Notion, Gmail.

### What to ignore (hype filters)
Shiny features not tied to your goal; vague “AI-powered” claims; hidden pricing; steep setup for beginners; weak export/integrations.

### 10-minute pilot test
Time-to-first-value; 3 sample tasks; one edge case; export/share; easy iteration. If a tool clears these with your G-B-X-I, ship it. If not, move on.
